# lines preceded with a # are ignored, the number of spaces between words is not important
# the following lines represents files and their corresponding upload info
# they have the format:

# filname username host port password source_folder destination_folder
# the destination_folder should use forward (/) slashes instead of (\) usually used for windows as folder seperators

# please make sure file names don't have spaces in them
